        <p class="guide-intro">
            The Student Recommendation System is designed to help students make informed decisions about their academic and career paths.
            By analyzing various factors such as academic performance, interests, and background, our system provides personalized recommendations
            tailored to each student's unique profile.

            <p>
                The system collects key information about students through a simple form. It then analyzes patterns and correlations to determine
                the best-fit subject for the student, along with additional recommendations based on academic strengths, career opportunities,
                and personal interests.
