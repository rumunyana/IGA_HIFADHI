# IGA_Capstone_1 

## **📌 Project Description**  
Rwanda’s secondary education sector faces challenges such as high dropout rates and a skills mismatch between students’ academic choices and labor market demands. This project addresses these issues by developing a Machine Learning–Powered Counseling Recommender System for O-Level and A-Level students in Kigali.  

The system integrates:  
1. Student performance data
2. Individual career interests  
2. Real-time labor market trends  

Using this information, it generates personalized subject and subject recommendations based on machine learning models.  

- **Classification Model**: Uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the most suitable academic track for a student.  
- **Hybrid Recommendation Model**: Combines **content-based filtering and collaborative filtering** to suggest the **top three most relevant subjects or career paths**.

## *Key Features*  
1. **Student Subject Prediction** – Uses Random Forest to classify the best-fit subject for students.  
2. **Personalized Recommendations** – Suggests **top three relevant subjects** using a hybrid recommendation approach.  
3. **User-Friendly Interface** – Students can easily input their details and receive personalized feedback.  
4. **Testimonial System** – Allows students to provide feedback on recommendations.  
5. **Secure Authentication** – User login and session-based authentication.
